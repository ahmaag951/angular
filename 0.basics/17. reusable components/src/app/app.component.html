<!-- <img [src]="imageUrl" /> 
this is the way how we send inputs to a dom object
<button (click)="onClick()"><button>
this is the way how we respond to a dom object

now we want to do this with our components 'favorite in this example' 
which means we want to send input to this component and listen for the changes that 
happens to this component, this is called 'component api', because it has input(property binding) and 
output (event binding) -->

<favorite [isFavorite]="false"  (change)="onFavoriteChanged($event)"></favorite>
<!-- $event represents anything that we pass when raising an event, in this case a boolean value, or
the whole object if you want -->
<!-- <favorite [is-favorite-alias]="false"></favorite> -->
