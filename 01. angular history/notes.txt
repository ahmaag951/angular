2010 => angular js
in mid 2016 => angular 2
and upgrades happened to angular 2 => 2.0 - 2.1 - 2.2 - 2.3 - 4
angular 4 was not a new framework with a lot of breaking changes 
so what happened to version 3
angular consists of a few different libraries that are distributed as separate node packages via npm like
@angular/core => 2.3.0
@angular/compiler => 2.3.0
@angular/http => 2.3.0
@angular/router => 3.3.0
all these libraries were version the same except the router library
so in order to align these versions and avoid confusion in the future angular team decided to go straight to angular version 4
so angular 4 is not a major update for angular 2 and you can think of it as angular 2.4
