    // There are different ways in JavaScript to create asynchronous code. The most important ones are the following:
    // Callbacks
    // Promises
    // Async/Await
    // RxJS Observables

    // in the callbacks you send function as a paramter to another function to be 
    // executed after the first function is finished
    this.callback1('ctor', this.callback2);

    // 2. promises
    // the promise differ from the callback in that you tell the promise what to do after it's finished not the vise versa
    let promise = this.asyncFunc();
    promise.then(result => console.log('the results from the promise: ', result));

    // 3. async/await
    // the async/await are just another syntax (syntax sugar) for the promise, it has been introduced in 
    // it tells the method to stop until the awaited method is finished
    // an async function returns a promise itself that is resolved with the functionâ€™s return value 
    // when the execution of the function body completes.
    // see the ngOnInit()

    // 4. observables
    // the observables are part of RxJS
    // RxJS is the JavaScript implementation of the ReactiveX project (project aims at providing an API for 
    // asynchronous programming for different programming languages)
    // the main difference between a promise and an observable is that a promise emits only a single value, 
    // whereas an observable emits multiple values
    // observable can do everything that a promise can do, but the reverse is not true

    // in the promise you can resolve (emit) only one value, but with observables you can emmit multiple values
    // just call next() every time you want to emit a new value, and then when you subscribe to that observable 
    // you will get these valuse by their order

    // we pass subscriber method to the ctor of the Observable
    // The subscriber function is called by the system whenever a new subscriber subscribes to the observable.
    // the observer object has a method next, which when called, emits the value that you pass it as argument from the observable
    // Note that after calling next, the subscriber function keeps running, and it can call next many more times. 
    // This is an important difference to promises, where after calling resolve the executor function is terminated
    // Promises can emit at most one value, whereas observables can emit any number of values.
    // to handle errors in promise use the resolve, and in observable use observer.error(error); it's like observer.next()
    // in observable If all successful... call  observer.complete(); either onCompleted or onError will be called but not both

    // if you tried to resolve multiple values with promise it will resolve only the first one
    /*
      const promise = new Promise(resolve => {
        resolve(1);
        resolve(2);
        resolve(3);
      });
      promise.then(result => console.log(result));
      This prints: 1 only
    */

    // the promise is eager and the observable is lazy
    // this means when you create the promise it will be automatically called
    let notCalledPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => console.log('from the notCalledPromise'));
    // but the observable will not be called until someone subscribe to it
    let notCalledObservable = new Observable(subscriber => subscriber.next('from notCalledObservable'));
    // this will not called unless you subscribed to it

    // the promise is not cancellable, so if you created promise that will do someting after 5 seconds you can't stop 
    // the then function from being executed
    // but the observable is cancellable, so you can unsubscribe to the observable

    // another thing ...
    // by default you can't make observable await, so you wait the result of observable
    // before doing some code, you have to convert it to promise by (toPromise)
    // for more information see sample (toPromise)


    const myObservable = new Observable(subscriber => {
      subscriber.next('I am the first value you will get');
      subscriber.next('I am the second value you will get');

        console.log('and after one second you will get this last value');
