<!-- if task.assignee is null, an error will happen
there are two solutions for this
1. using ngIf -->
<span *ngIf="task.assignee">{{ task.assignee.name}} </span>
<!-- 2. save traversal operator -->
<!-- the span exists in the dom but it's empty -->
<span>{{ task.assignee?.name}} </span>

if this line is shown, that means there are no errors in the page
