2010 => angular js
in mid 2016 => angular 2
and upgrades happend to ang 2 => 2.0 - 2.1 - 2.2 - 2.3 - 4
ang4 was not a new framework with alot of breaking changes 
so what happened to version 3
ang consists of a few different libraries that are distrubuted as seperate node packages via npm like
@angular/core => 2.3.0
@angular/compiler => 2.3.0
@angular/http => 2.3.0
@angular/router => 3.3.0
all these libraries were version the same except the router library
so in order to align these versions and avoid confusion in the future angular team desided to go straight to angular version 4
so angular 4 is not a major update for angular 2 and you can think of it as angular 2.4
